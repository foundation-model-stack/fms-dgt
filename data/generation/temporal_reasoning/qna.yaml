      "Hello! I'm here to help you understand the order of arrival at a party.
      Let's analyze the situation step by step:


      1. Joe reached first (before you).

      2. You arrived next.

      3. David arrived after you.

      4. John reached last (after David).


      Based on this information, Joe was the first one to arrive at the party, followed
      by you, then David, and finally John.

      "
    question:
      "Consider I went to a party. I reached before John. David arrived after.
      Joe reached before me. John arrived after David. Who reached first and who reached
      last?
